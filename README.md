# Fake News Prediction
Implemented a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as real or fake using Python and scikit-learn.

Preprocessed text data by applying stemming techniques and cleaning non-alphabetical characters to enhance model performance.

Utilized TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert textual data into numerical features, optimizing feature representation.

Built and trained a Logistic Regression model on preprocessed data, achieving robust classification performance.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data characteristics, handle missing values, and merge relevant features for improved insights.

Employed NLP techniques, including stopword removal and tokenization, to refine input data for machine learning.

Evaluated the model's accuracy using metrics such as accuracy score, ensuring high prediction reliability.
