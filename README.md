# üì∞ Fake News Prediction Web App

This is a machine learning web application built with **Flask** that detects whether a given news article is **Fake** or **Real**. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with a **Logistic Regression** model trained on a dataset of news articles.

Developed a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to classify news articles as Fake or Real.
Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with TF-IDF Vectorization for text preprocessing.
Built a Flask-based web application with a user-friendly interface using HTML and Bootstrap.
Trained the model on a labeled dataset of news articles and achieved high accuracy in predictions.
Serialized and saved the trained model and vectorizer using Pickle for deployment.
Integrated the model into the Flask app to provide real-time predictions from user input.
Designed a clean frontend to accept news text and display classification results instantly.
Installed and managed project dependencies using Conda and pip for smooth environment setup.
Ensured modular project structure with proper separation of frontend, backend, and model files.
Future-proofed the application with easy integration for deployment on platforms like Heroku, Render, or Vercel.
